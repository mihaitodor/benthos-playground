# Read historical data from a Kafka topic in combination with a `system_window`
# buffer.

# Bloblang variables are evaluated on startup if Benthos believes their input is
# static. Over here, we're abusing this property to get the `counter()` function
# to only run once on startup. This way, the `system_window` buffer won't drop
# data with a timestamp that's older than the current time.
